## What is a Graph? üåê

A **graph** is a data structure consisting of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Individual points or entities
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices

Graphs are everywhere in real life: social networks, road maps, computer networks, dependency graphs, and more!

```
Example Graph:
    A ---- B
    |      |
    |      |
    C ---- D
```

### Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction (friendship on social media)
- **Directed Graph**: Edges have direction (following on Twitter)
- **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights/costs (distance between cities)
- **Unweighted Graph**: All edges have equal weight

## Graph Representations üìä

### 1. Edge List
Stores all edges as a list of pairs.

```python
edges = [(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4)]
```

**Pros:** Simple, memory efficient for sparse graphs
**Cons:** Slow to check if edge exists, slow to find neighbors

### 2. Adjacency List
Each vertex maintains a list of its neighbors.

```python
graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [1, 4],
    4: [2, 3]
}
```

**Pros:** Memory efficient, fast neighbor lookup
**Cons:** Slow to check if specific edge exists

### 3. Adjacency Matrix
2D matrix where `matrix[i][j] = 1` if edge exists.

```python
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
]
```

**Pros:** Fast edge existence check, good for dense graphs
**Cons:** Uses O(V¬≤) space, inefficient for sparse graphs

## Traversal Algorithms üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores graph level by level using a queue.

```
Visual BFS Traversal:
Level 0:    A
Level 1:   / \
          B   C
Level 2:   \ /
            D
```

**Use Cases:**
- Finding shortest path (unweighted)
- Level-order traversal
- Connected components
- Bipartite graph checking

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Explores as far as possible along each branch using recursion/stack.

```
Visual DFS Traversal:
Path: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D ‚Üí C
```

**Use Cases:**
- Topological sorting
- Cycle detection
- Strongly connected components
- Maze solving

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-algorithms.git
cd graph-algorithms
```

2. **Run individual files:**
```bash
python edge_list_graph.py
python adjacency_list_graph.py
python adjacency_matrix_graph.py
python bfs_traversal_graph.py
python dfs_traversal_graph.py

## Problem Solving with Graphs üß©

### Common Graph Problems

1. **Shortest Path Problems**
   - Use BFS for unweighted graphs
   - Use Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs

2. **Connectivity Problems**
   - Use DFS/BFS to find connected components
   - Check if graph is connected

3. **Cycle Detection**
   - Use DFS with color coding
   - Important for detecting deadlocks

4. **Topological Sorting**
   - Use DFS for ordering dependencies
   - Useful for task scheduling

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify the Graph Structure**
   - What are the vertices and edges?
   - Is it directed or undirected?
   - Is it weighted?

2. **Choose the Right Representation**
   - Sparse graph ‚Üí Adjacency List
   - Dense graph ‚Üí Adjacency Matrix
   - Simple operations ‚Üí Edge List

3. **Select the Algorithm**
   - Need shortest path? ‚Üí BFS (unweighted)
   - Need to explore all paths? ‚Üí DFS
   - Need specific ordering? ‚Üí Topological Sort

### Example Problem: Social Network Analysis

```python
# Find mutual friends (intersection of adjacency lists)
def find_mutual_friends(graph, user1, user2):
    friends1 = set(graph[user1])
    friends2 = set(graph[user2])
    return friends1.intersection(friends2)

# Find degrees of separation (shortest path)
def degrees_of_separation(graph, user1, user2):
    # Use BFS to find shortest path
    # Implementation in bfs_traversal_graph.py
    pass
```

## Time & Space Complexity üìä

### Space Complexity Comparison

| Representation | Space Complexity |

| Add Edge | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Check Edge | O(E) | O(degree) | O(1) |
| Get Neighbors | O(E) | O(1) | O(V) |
